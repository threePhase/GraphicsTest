# GraphicsTest #

This is a simple triangle demo using OpenGL and GLFW.

## Requirements ##

- .NET Core 1.1.0
- OpenGL 3.3+

## Compatibility ##

Currently this demo only works on macOS Sierra due to the hardcoding of the
location of the system OpenGL library and macOS specific build of GLFW.

## Attribution ##

This demo was heavily inspired by: https://github.com/CameronAavik/dotnetcore-graphics-example
as well as: https://learnopengl.com/#!Getting-started/Hello-Triangle
